- differential gene expression analysis
- pathway enrichment analysis
- alignment of WES data
- analysis of high-throughput drug screen
I use python and R (packages from Bioconductor such as: cellHTS2, DESeq2, Biobase, ShortRead, Reactome.db, and others). Sometimes I have to write some bash scripts as well.
For alignment I use gsnap (I also have some experience with bowtie2).",Yes,Yes,(1) less,(5) more,-2,-3,(1) less,-2,-2,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(1) less,(5) more,(5) more,(5) more,(5) more,-2,(1) less,-3,(1) less,(5) more,"I already have some experience in the areas you mentioned above. For me it would be interesting to hear about the steps in WGS and WES data analysis. What have to be done (like quality control, alignment, ..) which parameters should be used (which are the best for which situation), how to evaluate data during each step and which tools are better for each step and situation. It would be also nice to hear about what can we learn from sequencing data.
(maybe also more advanced R?)"
